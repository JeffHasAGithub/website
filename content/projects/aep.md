I developed the website for Arctic Express Pack LLC, based out of Fort Worth, Texas.
The original version of the site used plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript with hosting
provided by GoDaddy.

Since then, I have migrated the site over to Linode with NGINX acting as a reverse proxy
to serve the app. The app itself uses a Nodejs backend to handle routing and templating
as well as MySQL for managing data.

You can visit the website [here](https://arcticexpresspack.com)!
