![Password Generator](/images/password.jpg)

A fully responsive password generator app written in Typescript and React.

In addition to allowing you to create passwords between 8 to 16 characters in length, the app provides options
for toggling several different character types for inclusion in the generation algorithm. Once you've created a
password that you're proud to call your own, click 'Copy to clipboard' to use it outside the app.
